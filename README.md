# SenseHat
This script takes temperature readings using the SenseHat emulator or SenseHat hardware, and stores them to a .csv file in the same directory. 
Currently it imports sense_emu, it can be changed to sense_hat and be used the same with Sense hat hardware.  

Will edit later to take other readings like pressure and gyro measurements. 

Next step: I need to edit the time the reading is taken, because it is not translating well to .csv programs for charts and analytics.
