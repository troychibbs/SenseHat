# SenseHat
This script takes temperature readings and stores them to a .csv file in the same directory. 
Currently it imports sense_emu, it can be changed to sense_hat and be used the same. 

Will edit later to take other readings

Next step:
  Create unique files on each run that are named with the date and time of run
